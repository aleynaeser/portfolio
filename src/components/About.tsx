        I have about 3 years of experience in software development, focusing on frontend. I actively contributed to all
        stages of design, planning, and development in projects and expanded my mobile development skills using Flutter. I
        specialize in creating user-friendly, creative interfaces and am constantly eager to learn new technologies. My aim
        is to collaborate with a team where I can contribute my expertise and strong work ethic while gaining new
        experiences.
